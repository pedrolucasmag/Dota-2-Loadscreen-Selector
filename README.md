Dota-2-Loadscreen-Selector
==========================

  Replaces the default HUD with any other HUD in the game. Completely legal (and VAC-proof, etc), as it simply extracts data from Dota 2's own game files and then mods it back in. Uses the excellent HLExtract tool. 
  Based on dota2-hudselector from [efskap](https://github.com/efskap).
